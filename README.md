**Project Title:** Online Banking System in C++

**Description:**
The Online Banking System in C++ is a comprehensive and user-friendly application that allows users to perform various banking operations through a command-line interface. With a strong emphasis on security and usability, this project enables users to register, log in, and manage their accounts seamlessly.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Registration:** Users can register by providing their name, phone number, and a secure password. The system validates the entered information and ensures unique phone numbers for each user.

2. **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their phone number and password combination. The system authenticates the user's credentials and grants access to their account.

3. **Account Management:** Once logged in, users have access to a range of banking operations, including checking their account balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and transferring money to other users.

4. **Transaction History:** Users can view their transaction history, allowing them to track their financial activities and monitor their account's status.

5. **Security:** The project implements robust security measures to protect user data and transactions. Passwords are securely hashed and stored, and the system includes mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code using a compatible compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable file to start the Online Banking System.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to register or log in and perform banking operations.
